# [Project 1 : matching-fun-game python project using PyGame library](https://github.com/khunwtf1/matching-fun-game)

Project Overview 

My project of Python Progamming subject. Students are assigned to do any program that is written in Python. After meeting with friends in the group came to the conclusion that I would write a matching game. I used to use TKinter to make User Interface before but had a few problems. So switched to PyGame.

Responsibility
- Design GUI for game using Adobe XD.
- Design game structures such as scoring, matching pictures, difficulty levels.
- Coding game code using Python (PyGame library) and Visual Studio Code (I used to use PyCharm before but had a few problems. So switched to VScode.)
